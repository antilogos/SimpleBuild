# SimpleBuild

Display build easily using RePoE and Horadric-helper
Use to store some friends builds and myself, mainly my guide for "first character".

How: 
* read a pob code (which is just a compressed XML object) and transform it into a JavaScript object
* parse this object to create a reference of all relevant object for Horadric Helper
* complete the reference of gem with data from RePoE so they are displayed with stats
* complete the reference of passive with data from official json tree so they are displayed with stats
* modified dom to display all gems, items, passive on the page (skill tree is build as an svg)
* save build to display them by storing them in a js file with meta-field, no publication mechanism

TODO:
* :art: better search page for saved build
* :art: see where and how image for items can be found and displayed (https://github.com/lvlvllvlvllvlvl/RePoE/tree/master/RePoE?)
* :art: find out why there is no description for support gem
* :construction: add support for french, and maybe other language? (hard to do from pob code with item names being in EN only)
* :construction: add vaal, non-superior, awakened, exceptionnal gem one day, and skill from item
* ðŸ”§ see if there is api for a passive skill tree in json preventing copy-paste each league (only in EN, from ggg github)
* ðŸ”§ see if possible to read a pastebin page (cors shenanigans)
* ðŸ”§ separate page construction and navigation from the main html
* ðŸ”§ see if possible to read an account from official website
