# SimpleBuild

Display build easily using RePoE and Horadric-helper
Use to store some friends builds and myself, mainly my guide for "first character".

How: 
* read a pob code (which is just a compressed XML object) and transform it into a JavaScript object
* parse this object to create a reference of all relevant object for Horadric Helper
* complete the reference of gem with data from RePoE so they are displayed with stats
* complete the reference of passive with data from official json tree so they are displayed with stats
* modified dom to display all gems, items, passive on the page (skill tree is build as an svg)
* save build to display them by storing them in a js file with meta-field, no publication mechanism

TODO:
* ðŸ”§ find out how to extract data from the game files so we can get description for support gem, better translation support, and uptadable path to image
* ðŸ”§ see if possible to read an account from official website and support it
